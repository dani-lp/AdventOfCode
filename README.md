# Advent of Code

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! A lot of ugly stuff, but who cares :D

Note: I initially did 2020 on Python and completed the puzzles until day 11, but I have on idea where the original code for that is. I later tried out some of the days on Rust, so that's the code that is uploaded.
